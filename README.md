--> RAI Ymca is a non-profit website created to help college students with study materials, guidance on online courses, and much more!

In the Pset8 of the CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course, we got the problem of developing a website with four inter-connected web pages. So, I came up with an idea, what if I solve a real-life problem while setting up this problem?
During Corona, we were stuck at home and were attending online classes due to lockdown. With no physical interaction with classmates, seniors or professors, we were not getting proper notes and guidance on online courses.
So, I got the idea to create a website for our newly started branch, where we will organize our complete data, i.e. syllabus, notes and online resources.

--> The development and hosting of this website were entirely done by me. Currently, I manage this website, and the credit of notes, syllabus and other resources present on the website go to my respected teachers and fellow friends.
